        <p>In text retrieval, full text search refers to techniques for searching a single computer-stored document or a collection in a full text database. Full-text search is distinguished from searches based on metadata or on parts of the original texts represented in databases (such as titles, abstracts, selected sections, or bibliographical references).</p>

        <p>    In a full-text search, a search engine examines all of the words in every stored document as it tries to match search criteria for example (text specified by a user). Full-text-searching techniques became common in online bibliographic databases in the 1990s.[verification needed] Many websites and application programs (such as word processing software) provide full-text-search capabilities. Some web search engines, such as AltaVista, employ full-text-search techniques, while others index only a portion of the web pages examined by their indexing systems.</p>
